# Quiz Application

## Overview

This is a simple quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches quiz questions from an external API, allows users to answer them, and provides a score at the end. The application uses a web worker to handle heavy computations for creating a ZIP file containing quiz data.
